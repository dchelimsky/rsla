This repo contains the slides (keynote and pdf) and (almost) all of the
code examples from my presentation at Rails Summit Latin America, 2009,
in SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

== .autotest

In the talk I did a demo of spork + autotest (autospec). Afterwards, an
attendee asked about how helpful autospec is in larger apps, and I
explained that it is possible to limit the scope of the files which
autotest observes.

I included my .autotest file (from my home directory), which contains
two plugins for autotest that demonstrate how this works and also how
I connect autotest to growl (I got the growl hook from a blog post 
somewhere).
